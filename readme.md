# Controllable Relation Disentanglement for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning

## Our code and pretrained models are all provided in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AH2VF4bbn7a3jQFiO3LAmbSp7NVBosAo?usp=sharing), since Google Drive does not have much limitations on the size of files.  

## For testing the performance of our models, please download our code and run the following commands step-by-step.  
### (Step-I) Download ctrl_fscil.zip from Google Drive and unzip it:: `unzip ctrl_fscil.zip;`
### (Step-II) Prepare environments:
cd ctrl_fscil;
conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate ctrl_fscil;
